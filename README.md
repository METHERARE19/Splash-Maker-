# Splash-Maker-
A tool for making SPLASH SCREEN
How use this script ?
---------------------
1) Clone this repo
2) Extract end.zip
3) Replace the splash screen with your images (use only .bmp files)
4) Click on generate_splash.cmd
5) Copy splash.img and META-INF to a new folder and zip it. :-)
----------------------
Thats it you made your own splash :-)


Note:
1) The META-INF i have include in this repo is for the device Redmi note 7 pro , if u use this this META-INF it will not flash.
2) Give correct resolution for the device , other wise it will be blank.
3) Use 16 bit format after editing the splash.
